# Human-Pose-Estimation

Implemented the DensePose algorithm by Facebook AI Research team to estimate 3D models of multiple humans in images and videos, on a single GPU, using Python.

â€¢ Performed object detection using Mask RCNN and pose estimation using Dense Regression on COCO and test images.
